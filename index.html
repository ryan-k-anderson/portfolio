            <h2> Background </h2>
            <p>
            My name is Ryan Anderson. I grew up in Jamestown NY and the past couple years I have lived in many places just trying to find the right fit for me to call home. I am a Jamestown High School Graduate of 2015. Graduating with an average GPA of 3.0. I originally wanted to pursue auto mechanics so I have done 2 years of vocational school while still in high school. After finding out that mechanics was not the best fit for me. I went onto Jamestown Community college where I pursued their welding program and graduated in May of 2018. I attempted to find work in that field but after careful studying I decided that profession was not a right fit for me either. Now in 2021 I took on a different approach moving from Trades to Computer Science. I am a graduate of Coding Dojo with my certificate in Full Stack Web Development but am more comfortable with front end and UX/UI design.

            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>
            I want to provide my best in a positive work environment whether it be a company or one person has a dream and wants to launch their own brand onto the internet. It is my job as a web developer to take concepts to design while learning and furthering my own skills to better service future clients and/or companies.

            <div class="main">
            <h2>Future Goals</h2> I do want to be able to make this my main job late on in life and be self sufficient enough to where I can personally achieve a balance of serving clients and have freedom to pursue life to its fullest enjoyment which I find to believe that is anyone's dream to achieve one day. I also want to be able to repay those who have helped me along the way in any way I can. I owe it to my support circle who has gotten me to where I am today.
